# ml-linear-regression-implementation
This project contains two implementations of linear regression (machine learning): one that I've written from scratch using gradient descent method, and another one using Scipy library. The goal of this project is to compare the performance and accuracy of both implementations and to provide a clear understanding of how linear regression works.
